# PAL preparation v1

Status: **superseded_before_production**. Snapshot: **2026-10-19T05:52:33.729730+00:00 UTC / 2026-10-19T14:52:33.729730+09:00 KST**.

Historical preparation only; no production cohort. Superseded by ../2026-10-01_draweropen_ddpg_pal_v2/. Do not count this as ten additional PAL runs.

## Code and provenance

- [source/](source/) contains the frozen executed/prepared source, protocol, tests, upstream copies and manifests.
- [source/README.md](source/README.md) is the ORIGINAL historical instruction file; its old pending/status text is not this snapshot's status.
- [provenance.json](provenance.json) records byte-identical source hashes and exported report hashes.
- Checkpoints, replay buffers, raw training logs, virtual environments and live process control files are omitted.
- Source dependencies and original local-path instructions are retained. Use the root materialization instructions before running tests or launchers; this is not a standalone reproduction bundle.
- No training is launched by browsing, exporting or verifying this archive. See [the archive guide](../../README.md).
